With this library you can evaluate math expressions.



Features:

1. Easy extensible (you can add more operations if you want)
2. Fast (expression compiling into native code)
3. Powerful (you can use variables and change it without side effects)
4. Supports .Net platform

At this point Expression Evaluator supports only Windows platform.
Compile isn't perfect now, but more faster, than generic solution.
